## APTOS2019
This is a starter solution for APTOS2019. Object of the competition is to train a model to determine how severe a eye deasies by retina image. 

* This is a Kaggle competition basic Keras code based on ResNet101 with TTA prediction.
* The competition is APTOS 2019(https://www.kaggle.com/c/aptos2019-blindness-detection), which original published on 2015(https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection).  

The trianing set and test set could be found in the Kaggle competition, but the best way to run the code in by the Kaggle Kernel
